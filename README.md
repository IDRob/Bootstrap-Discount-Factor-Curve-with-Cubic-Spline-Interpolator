# Bootstrap-Discount-Factor-Curve-with-Cubic-Spline-Interpolator
This programme uses market data on par interest rate swaps to bootstrap a discount factor curve using cubic spline interpolation.
This is an extension to MSc Financial Maths coursework completed at Queen Mary University of London.
It extends from course material produced by Michael J. Phillips, the text book 'Numerical Methods in Finance with C++' by M. Capinkski and T. Zastawniak and uses cubic spline methodology from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)#Algorithm_for_computing_natural_cubic_splines.
